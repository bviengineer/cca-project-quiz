                <h1>Question Six</h1>
                <h2>Name and describe 4 different kinds of positioning in CSS.</h2>
                <p>Four kinds of positioning in CSS are: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Static</li>had float right
                        <li>Relative</li> had float left
                        <li>Absolute</li>
                        <li>Fixed</li>
                    </ul>
                </p> 
            </section>
                <div id="absolute"><b>I am listed 1st in the HTML document.</b> My position is typically based on my nearest positioned ancestor and if the relationship doesn't exist, my position is relative to the position of the body of the document. When I assume my <span>absolute position</span> I move along with the scrolling of the page.</div>

                <div id="fixed"><b>I am listed 2nd in the HTML document.</b> Unlike my counterparts, I remain <span>fixed or in place</span> when scrolling and my position is relative to the browser window. Use the top, bottom, left or right properties to position me.</div>

                <div id="static">I'm in a <span>static position</span> and <b>is listed 3rd in the HTML document</b>. This is the default position of all elements and as my name implies, I remain in place or within the normal flow of the page.</div>
                
                <div id="relative">My position is <span>relative</span> and <b>I am listed 4th in the HTML document.</b> What that means is that though I physically move out of position on the page,  the space that I left is held and no other element takes it's place. When I relatively position myself, it's based on my original location or my space in the line. Set my top and left margins in order to move me around.</div>
